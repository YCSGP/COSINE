# COSINE

COSINE (COndition-SpecIfic sub-NEtwork) is a principled method to identify condition-specific sub-networks from gene expression profiles using a global optimization approach. It considers both differential expression of individual genes (node score) and differential correlation of gene pairs (edge score) simultaneously. More details can be found in the original paper: [COSINE: COndition-SpecIfic sub-NEtwork identification using a global optimization method](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/27/9/1290/243375).
